Write Clear Instructions:- Be specific: Clarity in instructions leads to more relevant outcomes.- Define the desired output length and complexity.- Demonstrate preferred formats.- Minimize ambiguity to enhance model accuracy.2. Provide Reference Text:- Counteract potential fabrications with concrete reference materials.- Reference texts guide the model towards accurate and reliable answers.3. Split Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks:- Break down tasks to reduce errors and improve manageability.- Consider tasks as workflows of simpler, interconnected steps.4. Give the Model Time to \"Think\":- Allow the model to process and reason, similar to a human solving a complex problem.- Encourage a \"chain of thought\" approach for more accurate reasoning.5. Use External Tools:- Supplement the model's capabilities with specialized tools for specific tasks.- Leverage resources like text retrieval systems or code execution engines.6. Test Changes Systematically:- Measure improvements with a comprehensive testing approach.- Ensure that modifications lead to overall performance enhancements.Full Guide: https://lnkd.in/gcQg3Pii\u2193Are you technical?

First, it created a tool that replaces googling in many scenarios surpassing it in quality of user experience. Second, it created a machine that pollutes Google's index with low-quality information while Google's main competitor, Bing, remains immune to this pollution due to the access to all ChatGPT-generated texts which gives it the ability to easily recognize these texts.2024 will be a hard year for Google. Gemini might become just another flop like Bard. Furthermore, I'm not sure it's even possible to replace the lost ad revenues with subscriptions to Gemini (assuming anyone would want to play for Gemini).\n\n", "\n\n\n I had a great time representing Weights & Biases at hashtag#NeurIPS2023, see below my key takeaways \u2764\ufe0f \n\n", "\n\n\n Not the H-1B lottery results you were hoping for?

Data-centric methods instead focus on improving the training data for better performance and improving the test data to make metrics more meaningful. \"DataPerf: Benchmarks for Data-Centric AI Development\" is a very interesting hashtag#NeurIPS2023 paper with a focus on data-centric methods.If your ML team spends 80% of their time on algorithmic improvements, try and redirect just 20% of this time to improving your data and you will get much better improvements compared to only focussing on chasing the latest models. Otherwise: Garbage in, garbage out.Tools like Argilla or Cleanlab make this quite easy.Link to paper DataPerf paper: https://lnkd.in/eXTFnaHB\n\n", "\n\n\n We evaluated the content of 50+ online resources for learning Quant Finance and picked out the top 11 recommendations1) IIT Kanpur Quant Finance course by Professor Raghu Nandan - https://lnkd.in/dHewAfYc2) IIT Bombay, Stochastic Process course by Prof. Manjesh Hanawalhttps://lnkd.in/gRq6f-NJ3) MIT Financial Mathematics course - https://lnkd.in/gwmmyWrz4) Yale Univerity Quantitative Finance course - https://lnkd.in/gqGXFGeZ5) Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance - https://lnkd.in/gPTRQMdc6) IIT Guwahati - Mathematical Finance https://lnkd.in/gHwrzhEa7) Introduction to computer science and programming in Python - https://lnkd.in/gFX4XZPp8) Computational Finance by Leipzig University- https://lnkd.in/gHMkr8Ue9) IIT Kanpur Probability and Stochastics for Finance - by Professor Joydeep Dutta - https://lnkd.in/ggDJkVgE10) Harvard Applied Mathematics - https://lnkd.in/gzrYZ7Ne11) Harvard CS50 \u2013 Full Computer Science University Course - https://lnkd.in/gK9qVMQX (If you don't have a coding background) kickstart your Quant Interview PrepCheck out Quant Insider Stack - https://lnkd.in/gcfdUEfgA Bundle of\u00a0Interview Byte, Quantopia Library, and Quant Insider Project Handbook\u00a0with Bonus Resources.\u2018Interview Byte\u2019 contains 1000+ Interview questions (https://lnkd.in/gkqcrrKf)Quantopia Library is the goldmine for building your domain knowledge and technical skills.

Sleeping consolidates and abstracts memory from hippocampus and moves them to long term memory in neocortex. This creates room for new experiences and learning. This process prevents forgetting the old when we learn  something new and enables  us to be life long learners.Deep Learning models have a well known problem called \u201ccatastrophic forgetting\u201d. In our pursuit to make a model more generalized when new similar task is trained the model tends to forget the old task it was already trained onNow researchers, taking inspiration from from the brain have come with a biologically inspired spiking neural network that simulates sleep. For us during sleep memory consolidation consists of replaying the short term memory with some noise so that it can be abstracted, consolidated and stored in the long term memory. That\u2019s exactly what they did. They had a rapidly alternating periods of training and sleeping for the first task while the second task was being learnt.hashtag#ai hashtag#deeplearning hashtag#forgetting hashtag#sleep hashtag#memory hashtag#learning hashtag#spiking hashtag#neuron hashtag#neocortex hashtag#hippocampus hashtag#neuroscience\n\n", "\n\n\n \ud83d\udd25Hot off the presses\ud83d\udd25 Laurie Voss's latest talk: a deep dive into retrieval-augmented generation, a code-level tutorial covering 7 advanced querying & retrieval techniques:\u2b50\ufe0f SubQuestionQueryEngine for complex questions\u2b50\ufe0f Small-to-big retrieval for improved precision\u2b50\ufe0f Metadata filtering, also for improved precision\u2b50\ufe0f Hybrid search including traditional search engine techniques\u2b50\ufe0f Recursive Retrieval for complex documents\u2b50\ufe0f Text to SQL\u2b50\ufe0f Multi-document agents that can combine all of these techniquesVideo: https://lnkd.in/dXSU-EMNAnd you can follow along with the slides here: https://lnkd.in/dDYQ9Qsj\n\n", "\n\n\n \ud83c\udf1f Insights from \"Financial Machine Learning\" by Bryan Kelly and Dacheng Xi\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd0d Key Takeaways:\ud83d\udcb9 Understanding Asset Prices: Prices as predictions, reflecting future payoffs and investor valuations.\ud83d\udcca Large Information Sets: The vast scope of information influencing market prices, highlighting the need for complex models.\ud83e\udd14 Ambiguity in Functional Forms: Traditional econometrics vs. machine learning in financial markets.\ud83e\udd16 Machine Learning vs. Econometrics: Blurring lines between these fields with advanced prediction models.\ud83d\udcc8 Return Prediction: Evaluating different models including linear, penalized linear, decision trees, and neural networks.\ud83c\udfe6 Risk-Return Tradeoffs: Exploring complex factor models and their implications in finance.\ud83d\udcb0 Optimal Portfolios: The shift from simple models to integrated estimation and optimization using machine learning.\ud83d\ude80 Future Directions: Recommendations for applying machine learning in financial contexts.\ud83d\udcda Fascinating Read!hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Finance hashtag#AssetPricing hashtag#PredictiveModels hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#PortfolioOptimization hashtag#FinancialMarkets hashtag#Econometrics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#InnovationInFinance\n\n"]}
