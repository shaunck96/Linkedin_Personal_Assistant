 Hi everyone! It is disheartening to share this news with you all that I was laid off from Groupon today as part of their plan for organizational realignment and workforce reduction. However, I've grown so much during my time, challenged myself countlessly, and gained so many coworkers I now call my friends. Thank you so much for everything, Groupon! Onwards and upwards from here. ðŸš€If you have any leads for opportunities in the Product Analytics/ Data driven Business Intelligence space, please let me know. I would appreciate the connection! I'm open for work now. Thank you in advance!PS: I am also on H-1B, and have less than 2 months to start a new position. hashtag#product hashtag#data hashtag#groupon hashtag#layoff hashtag#opentowork
